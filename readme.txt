Adds support for conditional fields to Contact Form 7.

== Description ==

This plugin adds conditional logic to [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/).

If you edit your CF7 form, you will see an additional tag called "Conditional fields Group". Everything you put between the start and end tag will be hidden by default.
After you added the field group(s), you should click Save.
Then you should go to the "Conditional fields" tab to create one or more conditions that will make the group(s) appear.
